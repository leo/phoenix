# What?

This repository contains the contents of a Safari Extension of mine, which basically injects a Stylesheet into Twitter's web interface every time you visit it. *Why?* — You might ask... Well, to get rid of the clutter that is distracting you from the content itself.

# "I want that too!"
1. Simply download the latest version from [here][1]
2. Install & activate it
3. You're finished! — Visit [Twitter][2] to test the extension. :zap:

## Afterword

Sadly, Apple currently doesn't allow for new Safari developers to add extensions to the official Extension Gallery.
